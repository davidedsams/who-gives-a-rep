## Introduction

My app is called Who Gives A Rep? I made this app for anyone who wants to find out who their government representatives are and at the same time teach people how government works.

## Planning Process

I came up with this idea thinking of simple ways to showcase my new programming abilities and have some practical use at the same time. I thought this would be a fun project that I can build on now and later as my skills improve. Many people find the subject of government confusing and I hope to change that with this app.

## Demonstrating the App

My app will have the ability to find the government representatives for any address in the United States. It will display a list of the representatives for that address along with their job titles and various links to contact them and to find out exactly what each individual rep’s roles and responsibilities are. For example, an official would have their name, title, email address, picture, and general info in one container and then in a column next to it have information that is also linked to more associated resources that tells which committees and bills the rep is working on and then in a column next to that one have links to what those committees actually are and links to explain how government is supposed to work. The columns will respectively reflect the who, what and how/why of modern politics.

## Demonstrating the Code

The most difficult part was just learning React and getting used to what it looks like and how it works. I learned again how a seemingly simple idea can turn out to be more complex and difficult.

## Highs and Lows

As one can see by looking at my app right now, so far I don’t have any functionality really unless you just happen to live on the east side of Atlanta… There have been a lot of unexpected delays and hiccups for me on this project and I hope I’ve at least learned how to manage my time better when working on projects such as this. I’m so excited to make my app better and I have my work cut out for me. There are so many features that I want to eventually add including some sort of message board where government officials are encouraged to answer general questions from users on the website. Some type of facts-based scoring system for each individual official would be fun to work on too. Like how dependable is this rep? Do they do what they say they will do? Are they available to contact in some real way? How do they compare to other reps? And so on. I’d also like a map option with different views available. You could see where each rep lives and also see demographics like income, property taxes, school districts, crime rates, etc for different addresses. Also, information on how and where to vote will be included.
